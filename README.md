# Merge-and-Reshape-Data-Visualization

This repository contains work for a problem set focused on analyzing and visualizing climate-related datasets. Using R, the tasks involve merging and reshaping data to explore trends in atmospheric CO2, global surface temperatures, and lower troposphere temperatures. Additionally, there is an analysis of name popularity trends over time.

Key Objectives:

CO2 and Temperature Analysis:

Explore relationships between atmospheric CO2 levels and global temperature anomalies.
Create visualizations showing trends in CO2 concentrations and temperature anomalies over time.
Analyze how CO2 levels and global temperatures are correlated.

Global vs. Troposphere Temperature:

Compare surface temperature data (HadCRUT) with lower troposphere satellite measurements (UAH).
Reshape datasets and visualize anomalies across time.

Name Popularity Trends:

Analyze the popularity of names over time using the U.S. baby names dataset.
Create trajectory plots to visualize trends across decades.

Included Files:

Climate data files (e.g., Scripps CO2, HadCRUT, and UAH datasets)
Scripts for data cleaning, merging, reshaping, and visualization
Plots and analyses for each task

Learning Outcomes:

This project demonstrates skills in data wrangling, merging datasets with varying time granularities, and creating meaningful visualizations to draw insights from real-world datasets.
